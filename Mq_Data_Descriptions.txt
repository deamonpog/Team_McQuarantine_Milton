Parameters (Independent Variables)
-----------------------------------
NumOfGroups : Number of groups of people. (values = {50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300})
GapNumSeats : Number of seats left off for social distancing. (values = {0, 4})
MinGroupSize : Minimum number of people that are in a group. (values = {1})
MaxGroupSize : Maximum number of people that is allowed for a group. (values = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8})
NumInfected : Number of Infected people in the population. (values = {10}) We made sure that each infected person is in a different group.
ContactDistance : Distance considered for counting as a contact/exposure (values = {33}) . 30 pixels was modeled as 1 yard. Therefore, 33 pixels is approximately 1 meter.
